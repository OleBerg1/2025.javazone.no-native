# Temporary template for JavaZone 2025

> ðŸ’¡ Project uses Expo which is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and web.
> This implementation uses React Native and TypeScript. The template implements a language feature using i18n, 
> which makes it easier to toggle between languages and avoid hard-coded text by having all text content stored as json.

### To do
- [ ] Caching of chosen language across routes
- [ ] Define template for styles and other assets
- [ ] Prettier config
- [ ] Change expo account to javaBin account
- [ ] Use javaBin iOS bundle identifier

**Credits:**
The i18next language feature was implemented by following a [tutorial](https://ilearnedathing.com/internationalizing-a-react-native-app-with-i18next-and-expo-part-1) by Richard Westmoreland
